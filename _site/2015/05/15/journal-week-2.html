<p>What is MVC?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Model: Where functions are located. Stores data that is retrieved by the controller and displayed in the view. Whenever there is a change to the data it is updated by the controller.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>View: Display, Interface, what the user sees and reacts to. Requests information from the model that it uses to generate an output representation to the user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Controller: Connects the view and model. tells the model and view what to do after recieving input.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Principle of Encapsulation</p>

<ul>
  <li>Packing of data and functions into a single component.</li>
  <li>A language mechanism for restricting access to some of the object’s components.</li>
  <li>A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is scoping in Javascript?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Global: a var that is set outside any function that will apply to every bit of code below it that calls it.</li>
  <li>Local: a var that is used within a function that can only be used within the given function.</li>
</ul>
