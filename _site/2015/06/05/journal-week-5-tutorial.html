<p>When styling a document there’s a couple ways one can color backgrounds and fonts. You can use the actual name of the color BUT, there’s only a finite amount of colors that can called out by there name. How else would you call the rest of the colors in the spectrum then? Why using hexadecimal numbers of course.</p>

<p>What are hexadecimal numbers? They are numbers that have a base of 16 instead of a base of 10 (what we are used to seeing). A base in hexadecimal is 0-9 and a-f and consists of up to 6 numbers. An example would be 
<code>
body {
color: #0f7d8e;
}
</code>
The other way with the finite amount of text colors is 
<code>
body {
color: blue;
}
</code></p>
