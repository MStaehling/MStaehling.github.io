**Self Closing Tags**: Tags that close themselves. There's nothing that would go inbetween the tags so there's no need for a closing tag (</....>). All the information is within the the tag itself.

Some examples of self closing tags are:

* **[link] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)**: a tag the links the html to another document, usually a CSS folder
* **[meta] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta)**: represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (`<base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>`).
