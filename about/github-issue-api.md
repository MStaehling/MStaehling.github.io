 How can I fetch all Issues from the API...
 
 
    * assigned to a specific user?
    
    
    * created in a specific repo?
    
    
    * assigned to a specific milestone? ...to any milestone? ...to none?
    
    
    * that are still open? ...closed? ...either?
    
    
  What is the structure of an Issue resource?
  
  
    * What fields are _always_ returned?
    
    
    * What fields are _optionally_ returned?
    
    
    * What are the types and sample contents of _all_ returned fields?
    
    
  How can I fetch all Milestones from the API? ...Labels?
  
  
  What is the structure of the Milestone and Label resources?
  
  
  How would I fetch...
  
  
    * ...all the _open_ Issues from a specific repo...
    
    
    * ...with the label "Attendance"...
    
    
    * ...sorted oldest first?
    
    
    * ...with 100% task completion?
    
    
  **BEAST MODE** How would I...
  
  
    * ...fetch Issues for an assigned Milestone...
    
    
    * ...group them by Label...
    
    
    * ...and calculate percentage of total Issues?
