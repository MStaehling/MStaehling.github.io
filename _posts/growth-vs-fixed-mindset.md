All humans are essentially born the same. We start out with no knowledge of anything and ready to learn. We learn how to walk, talk, read, do math, and many other things over the years. We use our brains to gain this knowledge. The brain is like a muscle and can be strengthened like other muscles in your body. The more you go to the gym and work out, the more your muscles will grow. If you ignore the workout routine, your muscles will decrease size. The brain operates similarly. The more you try to learn and grow in knowledge, the stronger your brain will become. If you become apathetic about learning new things, then your brain will deteriorate.

A fixed mindset is based on nature. It assumes one is born gifted or has natural talents and can not learn much more than what nature allows them or has given them. When someone with a fixed mindset is praised by others for being intelligent without effort, they may feel their achievements are out of their control. This praise may make the person to not want to aceept challenges because of a fear of failure. They want to do what they know is easy to ensure success and maintain a sense of intelligence. When they come across an error they may run away, make excuses and not try to solve the problem rather than risk additional failure.. This kind of mindset leads to a joyless achievement.

A growth mindset is nurture based. It assumes an ability to learn with effort. Effort, practice, and hard work produces knowledge gains and anyone is capable of learning if they are willing to put in the work. It believes that abilities and intelligence can be developed. Someone with this mindset will embrace a challenge. If they come across an error they will struggle to solve the issue rather than avoid it. The process of learning is as important as the end result. A person with this type of midnset will love learning and will be confident and happy about their work.

In high school I had a fixed mindset. School came easy for me, and I never had to apply myself. It was not until college that I needed to put any effort into studying for my classes. The courses were still not very hard, but they required more studying than I was used to. Being of a fixed mindset, I did not like having to study.  I wanted to continue to succeed without effort. I did not apply myself like I could and should have. I received passing grades but nowhere near the kind of grades I should have received.

I am at a point in my life where I realize I have not used my full learning potential. I did not utilize my learning potential in high school or college, and was not fulfilled in my life choices. I am fortunate to have a good foundation and I pick up on new ideas and information easily. I always knew I could pursue many different careers. But I settle in to what was easy rather than push myself to another level. Now, I want to see what I am made of. I want to reach my maximum learning potential, challenge myself, and I am willing to put in the effort to achieve this goal. This cohort is an ideal environment to challenge myself in ways I have not utilized previously.

Although I do believe some are born with gifted and/or natural talents, I do not believe that they should neglect the pursuit of additional knowledge or development of these skills. I believe people should acknowledge their inborn talents and strive to reach full potential. A fixed mindset limits a person's ability to control their achievments. No matter how much or how little knowledge someone might have, the mindset that person has about learning has a bigger impact on how and what they learn than how much knowlege they start with. Anyone who has been blessed with a talent and does not think they need to work on it is placing unnecessary limits on their life. Someone with a growth mindset has no natural limits and can achieve as long as they are willing to put in the work.
