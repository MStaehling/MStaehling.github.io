What is MVC?

* Model: Where functions are located. Stores data that is retrieved by the controller and displayed in the view. Whenever there is a change to the data it is updated by the controller.

* View: Display, Interface, what the user sees and reacts to. Requests information from the model that it uses to generate an output representation to the user.

* Controller: Connects the view and model. tells the model and view what to do after recieving input.


Principle of Encapsulation

* Packing of data and functions into a single component.
* A language mechanism for restricting access to some of the object's components.
* A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.



What is scoping in Javascript?

* Global: a var that is set outside any function that will apply to every bit of code below it that calls it.
* Local: a var that is used within a function that can only be used within the given function.
